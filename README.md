### Marker Clusterer Plus & Overlapping Marker Spiderfier

This is a demo example on how to use `Marker Clusterer Plus` and a `Overlapping Marker Spiderfier` at the same time.

### How to install

To install all need it dependencies run:
```shell
npm install
```

To see the example in action.
```shell
npm start
```


## How it works?

For each Marker instance created, you also need to add it into the `Spiderifer`. The `Spiderifer` will detect that
Markers are in the same location and it will generate the `Spider effect`.
